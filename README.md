# Karoo Hammerhead Style 

Mapsforge map style for OpenAndroMaps optimized for Karoo 2/3 and MTB modified by thegab.

## Instructions:
- Download this file (the correct one, Karoo updates these files in some releases). Sometimes if you download xml files in github, it can have some problems. Please download the whole project (zip) and uncompress it. You can also download the raw file (not copy the raw file).
- Backup original karoo theme (offline_vXX.xml) before replacing it with this one. 
- Download manual version of the latest elevate theme (http://www.openandromaps.org/en/legend/elevate-mountain-hike-theme), uncompres it and copy the folder "ele-res" to the /mnt/sdcard/ folder on your Karoo device.
- Copy this file to the /mnt/sdcard/ folder on your Karoo device (overwriting the existing offline_vXX.xml file).
- For map files, please download the OpenAndroMaps (OAM) (https://www.openandromaps.org/en/downloads) files you want and name them differently than the original ones. For example if you have the map 'bayern.map' you need to add another map file with name 'bayern_oam.map' so that both files are in the offline/maps folder. This way you can keep using the heatmaps and heightlines from before. If you simply replace the original maps with the new ones from OAM they will be deleted and overwritten at next startup of the device.
